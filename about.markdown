    <h3>Hi there!</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Fabio, I am a software developer, and this blog is about things I
      find interesting in tech.<br>
      I write here to keep track of stuff I learn working with computers, and
      to point people to structured, long form versions of my thoughts.<br>
      I'm glad you're here, and thanks for reading.
